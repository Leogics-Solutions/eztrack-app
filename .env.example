# Backend API Configuration
# Set the base URL for the backend API
# Defaults to http://localhost:8000 if not set
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:8000

# Alternative: You can also use NEXT_PUBLIC_URL (for backward compatibility)
# NEXT_PUBLIC_URL=http://localhost:8000

# Note: Application settings (like Business Central integration enable/disable)
# are managed through the Settings API endpoint and stored in the backend database.
# These settings can be configured via the Settings page in the application UI.
